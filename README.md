# WPT Efficiency ML Predictor

This Streamlit app predicts wireless power transfer (WPT) efficiency from coil and hardware parameters using a machine learning model.

## How to Use
- Enter coil geometry, turns, gap, offset, frequency, Q-factor, voltage, current, ferrite, and shield.
- Click 'Predict Efficiency' to get your result.

## How it Works
Trained on simulated data for wireless power transfer, the app uses a RandomForest model to estimate system efficiency for design and educational use.
